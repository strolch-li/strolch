## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, then please send an email to eitch@eitchnet.ch. You might encrypt it using KeyOxide with my public GPG key: https://kxd.eitchnet.ch/b1359c320a72a2907f1a7f7875db9c85c74331f7

We will then consider the vulnerability and shall try our best to close the vulnerability as soon as possible if it is part of an active branch and a fix is possible.
